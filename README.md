The corresponding README.md files under the individual project folder gives a detailed description on the requirement and implementation:
1. [Postgres](https://github.com/git-nami/Sparkify/blob/master/Postgres/README.md)
2. [Cassandra](https://github.com/git-nami/Sparkify/blob/master/Cassandra/README.md) 
3. [Data Warehouse on Redshift](https://github.com/git-nami/Sparkify/blob/master/Redshift_Data_Warehouse/README.md)
4. [Data Warehouse on Redshift Automation using Airflow](https://github.com/git-nami/Sparkify/blob/master/Airflow/README.md)
5. [Data Lake on Spark](https://github.com/git-nami/Sparkify/blob/master/Spark_Data_Lake/README.md)
